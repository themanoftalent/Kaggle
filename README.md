# Kaggle Projects and Experiments

Welcome to this repository, which serves as a centralized workspace for my Kaggle activities. Whether it's competition entries, data analysis experiments, or the development of machine learning pipelines, everything will be documented and structured here.

## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized around individual Kaggle challenges or themes. Each competition or project will have its own directory that typically includes:

- Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling
- Experiment logs with details on models tested, parameters used, and evaluation metrics
- Summary notes containing key insights, feature importance, and post-mortem analyses
- References to datasets used (linked to Kaggle sources)

## Objectives

The primary goals of this repository are:

- To explore a wide variety of machine learning and deep learning techniques
- To build reusable, modular code for rapid experimentation
- To evaluate different strategies for improving model accuracy and generalization
- To apply bio-inspired optimization and explainability frameworks to real-world data
- To maintain transparency and reproducibility in all experiments

## Technical Stack

This project utilizes tools and libraries from the following categories:

- Programming and Data Handling: Python, pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
- Deep Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow (depending on project scope)
- Optimization: Red Piranha Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, Optuna
- Explainability: SHAP, LIME
- Competition-Specific APIs: Kaggle CLI, custom loaders and evaluators

## Projects Included

Some of the ongoing or planned projects include:

- March Madness Machine Learning Mania 2025
- Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Challenge 2025
- Rainfall Prediction â€“ Kaggle Playground Series
- Custom medical imaging challenges using segmentation and diagnosis models

Each project is supported with detailed notebooks, preprocessing scripts, evaluation functions, and summaries of results and learnings.
